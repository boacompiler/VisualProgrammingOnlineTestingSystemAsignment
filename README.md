# Visual Programming Online Testing System Asignment

This was an assignment. 
There are significant issues with this as a testing system, but they were not a requirement of the assignment.

main issues:
* answers stored in plaintext in root
* no verification of student credentials
* the name "Master" will over write the master test file

the program can be built using Visual Studio
